<h3> About </h3>

I am a remote sensing and atmospheric scientist, currently working for [Solafune Inc.](https://solafune.com/en) as lead researcher. 


Previously, I was a [planetary scientist](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/planetary-science/what-planetary-science) interested in planetary atmospheres and climates.
I was CSH fellow at the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern where I worked on understanding climate variability on exoplanets. Before that, I was working on understanding climate variability on Venus using remote sensing data from the Venus Climate Orbiter mission, Akatsuki at the University of Tokyo. 

Here is a short [CV](PushkarKopparla_Resume.pdf)

<h3> Work Samples </h3>

[Notebook](https://github.com/pkopparla/Venus-image-processing) An implementation of the image processing procedure to convert satellite observations of Venus by the JAXA mission Akatsuki into gridded datasets.

[Repo](https://github.com/pkopparla/ContainerizeSatimagePreview) A Dockerized Python pipeline that creates a scaled, color corrected JPEG preview for RGB bands from a given Landsat scene. Also has notes on creating and testing AWS Lambda functions from custom Docker images.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFKRFUXppE) A talk on understanding long period variability in Venus clouds. Given at the Venus Science Conference by PRL on 23 Sep 2021.

[Map](https://www.livehistoryindia.com/story/amazing-india/aihole-inscription/) A map of the historical Chalukya kingdom, made with QGIS using OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia data. The map is the fourth figure in the linked article.
