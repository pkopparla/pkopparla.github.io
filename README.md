<h3> About </h3>

I am a [planetary scientist](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/planetary-science/what-planetary-science) interested in planetary atmospheres and climates.

I'm currently CSH fellow at the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern. I work on understanding climate variability on exoplanets. Previously, I was working on understanding climate variability on Venus using remote sensing data from the Venus Climate Orbiter mission, Akatsuki at the University of Tokyo. Recently I've been looking into Earth observing and the tech around it.

Here is a short [CV](PushkarKopparla.pdf)

<h3> Work Samples </h3>

[Notebook](https://github.com/pkopparla/Venus-image-processing) An implementation of the image processing procedure to convert satellite observations of Venus by the JAXA mission Akatsuki into gridded datasets.

[Repo](https://github.com/pkopparla/ContainerizeSatimagePreview) A Dockerized Python pipeline that creates a scaled, color corrected JPEG preview for RGB bands from a given Landsat scene. Also has notes on creating and testing AWS Lambda functions from custom Docker images.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmFKRFUXppE) A talk on understanding long period variability in Venus clouds. Given at the Venus Science Conference by PRL on 23 Sep 2021.

[Map](https://www.livehistoryindia.com/story/amazing-india/aihole-inscription/) A map of the historical Chalukya kingdom, made with QGIS using OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia data. The map is the fourth figure in the linked article.
