<h3> About </h3>

I am a [planetary scientist](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/planetary-science/what-planetary-science) interested in planetary atmospheres and climates.

I'm currently CSH fellow at the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern. I work on understanding climate variability on exoplanets. Previously, I was working on understanding climate variability on Venus using remote sensing data from the Venus Climate Orbiter mission, Akatsuki at the University of Tokyo.

<h3> Projects / Code </h3>

[Notebook](grid_walkthrough.html) A walkthrough to understand the extraction of regular gridded atmospheric data from spacecraft images of Venus, including pointing correction from limb fitting.
